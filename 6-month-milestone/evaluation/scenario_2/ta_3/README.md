# TA3 Evaluation Results

Included is a reproducible markdown script which includes the analysis and inline evalution code recreating
the full analysis of Scenario 2 from start to finish. For full reproducibility, we have ensured that it
works on a remote server that runs from scratch with strict unit testing enabled. The results of the build
can be found at:

https://chrisrackauckas.github.io/ASKEM_Evaluation_Staging/dev/Scenario2/Evaluation_Scenario_2/

Full reproducibility instructions are given in:
