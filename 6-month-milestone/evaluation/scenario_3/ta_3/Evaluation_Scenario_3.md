# Evalution Scenario 3

```@example evalscenario3
using EasyModelAnalysis, LinearAlgebra
```

## Question 1

## Setup Model

>  1. Begin with a basic SIR model without vital dynamics. Calibrate the model parameters using data on cases during the ‘training period’. Then evaluate the model during the out-of-sample ‘test period’.

To get started with the code, we implemented the basic SIR without vital dynamics directly in ModelingToolkit.jl. This is a version
that was written by an epidemiologist at Microsoft Pandemic, Simon Frost, who has become a fan of the TA3 automated simulation tools
and wrote an entire repository of tutorials for this software. It is found at https://github.com/epirecipes/sir-julia.

In there is an SIR without vital dynamics which we took in full.

```@example evalscenario3
@parameters t β=0.05 c=10.0 γ=0.25
@variables S(t)=990.0 I(t)=10.0 R(t)=0.0
∂ = Differential(t)
N = S + I + R # This is recognized as a derived variable
eqs = [∂(S) ~ -β * c * I / N * S,
    ∂(I) ~ β * c * I / N * S - γ * I,
    ∂(R) ~ γ * I];

@named sys = ODESystem(eqs);
```

```@example evalscenario3
tspan = (0.0, 40.0)
prob = ODEProblem(sys, [], tspan);
sol = solve(prob);
```

```@example evalscenario3
plot(sol)
```

### Perform Model Calibration

#### Model Calibration Unit Test

As a unit test of the model calibration tools, we generated data at the default parameters, then ran the global optimization,
to see how well the parameters were recovered.

```@example evalscenario3
dataset = solve(prob, saveat = 0.1)
t_train = dataset.t[1:201]
t_test = dataset.t[202:end]
data_train = [S => dataset[S][1:201], I => dataset[I][1:201], R => dataset[R][1:201]]
data_test = [S => dataset[S][202:end], I => dataset[I][202:end], R => dataset[R][202:end]]
```

```@example evalscenario3
fitparams = global_datafit(prob, [β => [0.03, 0.15], c => [9.0, 13.0], γ => [0.05, 0.5]],
                           t_train, data_train)
```

This then gives the forecasts in the test data:

```@example evalscenario3
_prob = remake(prob, p = fitparams)
sol = solve(_prob, saveat = t_test);
plot(sol, idxs = S)
plot!(t_test, data_test[1][2])
```

```@example evalscenario3
plot(sol, idxs = I)
plot!(t_test, data_test[2][2])
```

```@example evalscenario3
plot(sol, idxs = R)
plot!(t_test, data_test[3][2])
```

This looks very good and matches the original data, confirming that the inverse problem functionality is functional.

#### Application to Real Data from TA1

## Question 2: Add Hospitalizations and Deaths

Question 2 involves doing the same analysis as question one but on the SIR model with hopsitalizations and deaths included.
To establish unit tests, we first showcase building the model and solving inverse problems using the ModelingToolkit version
of the model.

```@example evalscenario3
@parameters t β=0.1 c=10.0 γ=0.25 ρ=0.1 h=0.1 d=0.1 r=0.1
@variables S(t)=990.0 I(t)=10.0 R(t)=0.0 H(t)=0.0 D(t)=0.0
∂ = Differential(t)
N = S + I + R + H + D # This is recognized as a derived variable
eqs = [∂(S) ~ -β * c * I / N * S,
    ∂(I) ~ β * c * I / N * S - γ * I - h * I - ρ * I,
    ∂(R) ~ γ * I + r * H,
    ∂(H) ~ h * I - r * H - d * H,
    ∂(D) ~ ρ * I + d * H];

@named sys2 = ODESystem(eqs);
```

```@example evalscenario3
prob2 = ODEProblem(sys2, [], tspan);
sol = solve(prob2);
```

```@example evalscenario3
plot(sol)
```

The inverse problem solving is done via the same functionality as before.

```@example evalscenario3
fitparams2 = global_datafit(prob2, [β => [0.03, 0.15], c => [9.0, 13.0], γ => [0.05, 0.5]],
                            t_train, data_train)
```

Notice that this fit is not as good. That is to be expected because it's fitting the SIRHD model on the
SIR model's output data. Thus we should expect that it also does not forecast entirely correctly.

```@example evalscenario3
_prob2 = remake(prob2, p = fitparams2)
sol = solve(_prob2, saveat = t_test);
plot(sol, idxs = S)
plot!(t_test, data_test[1][2])
```

```@example evalscenario3
plot(sol, idxs = I)
plot!(t_test, data_test[2][2])
```

```@example evalscenario3
plot(sol, idxs = R)
plot!(t_test, data_test[3][2])
```

This checks out.

### Evaluate Model Forecasts

In order to evaluate the model forecasts, we developed a functional which does the forecasting part with multiple models
and puts a score on the forecast result. This score is calculated using the L2 norm. It was added to the EasyModelAnalysis.jl
library in https://github.com/SciML/EasyModelAnalysis.jl/pull/129 as part of the evaluation on day 1.

```@example evalscenario3
norm(solve(_prob, saveat = t_test)[S] - data_test[1][2]) +
norm(solve(_prob, saveat = t_test)[I] - data_test[2][2]) +
norm(solve(_prob, saveat = t_test)[R] - data_test[3][2])
```

```@example evalscenario3
norm(solve(_prob2, saveat = t_test)[S] - data_test[1][2]) +
norm(solve(_prob2, saveat = t_test)[I] - data_test[2][2]) +
norm(solve(_prob2, saveat = t_test)[R] - data_test[3][2])
```

## Question 3: Add Vaccinations

Question 3 is the same analysis as questions 1 and 2 done on a model with vaccination added. In order to build unit tests for
the analysis and functionality, we started by building the model with vaccine by hand, awaiting a swap to the version from
TA2.

```@example evalscenario3
@parameters t β=0.1 c=10.0 γ=0.25 ρ=0.1 h=0.1 d=0.1 r=0.1 v=0.1
@parameters t β2=0.1 c2=10.0 ρ2=0.1 h2=0.1 d2=0.1 r2=0.1
@variables S(t)=990.0 I(t)=10.0 R(t)=0.0 H(t)=0.0 D(t)=0.0
@variables Sv(t)=990.0 Iv(t)=10.0 Rv(t)=0.0 Hv(t)=0.0 Dv(t)=0.0
@variables I_total(t)

∂ = Differential(t)
N = S + I + R + H + D + Sv + Iv + Iv + Hv + Dv # This is recognized as a derived variable
eqs = [∂(S) ~ -β * c * I_total / N * S - v * Sv,
    ∂(I) ~ β * c * I_total / N * S - γ * I - h * I - ρ * I,
    ∂(R) ~ γ * I + r * H,
    ∂(H) ~ h * I - r * H - d * H,
    ∂(D) ~ ρ * I + d * H, ∂(Sv) ~ -β2 * c2 * I_total / N * Sv + v * Sv,
    ∂(Iv) ~ β2 * c2 * I_total / N * Sv - γ * I - h2 * I - ρ2 * I,
    ∂(Rv) ~ γ * I + r2 * H,
    ∂(Hv) ~ h2 * I - r2 * H - d2 * H,
    ∂(Dv) ~ ρ2 * I + d2 * H, I_total ~ I + Iv,
];

@named sys3 = ODESystem(eqs)
sys3 = structural_simplify(sys3)
```

The unit test analysis code is as follows:

```@example evalscenario3

```

## Question 4: Age-Stratified Model

Question 4 is the same analysis as questions 1, 2, and 3 on a model with age-stratification added. In order to build unit tests for
the analysis and functionality, we started by building the model with vaccine by hand, awaiting a swap to the version from
TA2.

## Question 5: Add Reinfection

Question 5 is the same analysis as questions 1, 2, 3, and 4 on a model with reinfection added. In order to build unit tests for
the analysis and functionality, we started by building the model with vaccine by hand, awaiting a swap to the version from
TA2.

## Question 6: New Data

Question 6 is currently awaiting data from TA3

## Question 7: Analysis

For each model, summarize your conclusions about the following:

 1. Do parameters fit from data seem reasonable and fall within typical ranges you might see in the broader literature? Provide references to support your conclusions.
 2. Describe how well the fitted model compares against historical data, both for the ‘training’ and ‘test’ periods.

### Answer

Question 7 is currently awaiting data from TA3
